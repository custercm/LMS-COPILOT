# LMS Copilot File Operations Guide

## Overview
LMS Copilot now supports comprehensive file operations through both drag-and-drop interface and natural language commands.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Drag and Drop File Upload
- **How to use**: Simply drag files from your file system into the chat interface
- **What happens**: Files are automatically uploaded to your workspace and analyzed by AI
- **Supported**: All file types with intelligent analysis for text, code, images, and data files

### 2. Natural Language File Operations

#### Create Files
- **Command**: "Create a new file called `filename.js` with basic React component"
- **What happens**: AI generates appropriate content and creates the file
- **Example**: "Create a TypeScript interface file for user data"

#### Edit Files
- **Command**: "Edit `src/main.ts` to add error handling"
- **What happens**: AI reads the current file, applies changes, and shows diff for approval
- **Example**: "Modify the login function to use async/await"

#### Search Files
- **Command**: "/search authentication" or "Find all references to 'login'"
- **What happens**: Searches across workspace and shows results
- **Example**: "/search TODO" to find all TODO comments

#### Analyze Workspace
- **Command**: "Analyze my workspace" or "/workspace structure"
- **What happens**: AI analyzes project structure and provides insights
- **Example**: "What type of project is this?"

### 3. VS Code Terminal Integration
- **Feature**: All terminal commands use VS Code's integrated terminal
- **Security**: Commands are validated before execution
- **Example**: "/run npm install" creates a terminal and runs the command

## Available Commands

### File Commands
- `/files search <query>` - Search for files matching query
- `/files create <path>` - Create new file with AI assistance
- `/search <term>` - Search content across workspace
- `/workspace` - Show workspace information

### Development Commands
- `/run <task>` - Execute task in terminal
- `/explain <code>` - Explain selected code or file
- `/debug` - Start debugging session

## How File Operations Work

### 1. Permission System
- All file operations require permission approval
- User is prompted before any write operations
- Read operations are logged for security

### 2. AI Integration
- **File Creation**: AI generates appropriate content based on description
- **File Analysis**: Automatic analysis of uploaded files
- **Code Assistance**: AI helps with editing and explaining code

### 3. Terminal Integration
- Uses VS Code's integrated terminal API
- No shell command execution for security
- All commands are validated and logged

## Testing the Features

### Test File Upload
1. Open the LMS Copilot chat panel
2. Drag any file from your computer into the chat area
3. See automatic analysis and AI response

### Test File Creation
1. Type: "Create a new README.md file for this project"
2. Approve the file creation when prompted
3. Check that the file was created with appropriate content

### Test Search
1. Type: "/search function" to find all function definitions
2. See search results displayed in chat

### Test Workspace Analysis
1. Type: "/workspace" or "Analyze my project structure"
2. Get AI insights about your project

## Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam requests
- **Command Validation**: Dangerous commands are blocked
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged
- **Permission Checks**: User approval required for sensitive operations

## File Types Supported
- **Text Files**: .txt, .md, .json, .xml, .yaml
- **Code Files**: .js, .ts, .py, .java, .cpp, .html, .css
- **Data Files**: .csv, .json with structure analysis
- **Images**: Basic metadata extraction
- **Documents**: .pdf with text extraction (planned)

## Error Handling
- Clear error messages for failed operations
- Automatic retry suggestions
- Fallback to basic operations if AI features fail

**Note**: All file operations respect VS Code's workspace settings and security policies. The extension integrates with existing VS Code features like version control, debugging, and terminal management.
