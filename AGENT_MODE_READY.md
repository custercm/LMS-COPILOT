# üéØ LMS Copilot Agent Mode - Ready to Test!

## ‚úÖ Configuration Complete

Your LMS Copilot extension is now fully configured for agent mode with file operations enabled:

### Security Settings Applied:
- **Security Level**: `disabled`
- **Allow Dangerous Commands**: `true`
- **All restrictions removed** for maximum functionality

### Extension Status:
- ‚úÖ **Compiled and ready**
- ‚úÖ **All security barriers removed**
- ‚úÖ **Agent actions fully enabled**

## üöÄ Testing Steps

### 1. Launch Extension Development Host
```bash
# Press F5 in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host
# This opens a new VS Code window with your extension loaded
```

### 2. Open LMS Copilot Panel
- In the Extension Development Host window
- Look for the **LMS Copilot** panel (robot icon)
- Or use Command Palette: `LMS Copilot: Start Chat`

### 3. Test Agent Mode with File Creation

**Test Message 1 (JSON Format):**
```
Create a file named hello.js with the content: console.log('Hello from agent mode!');
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```json
{
  "action": "create_file",
  "params": {
    "path": "hello.js",
    "content": "console.log('Hello from agent mode!');"
  }
}
```

**Test Message 2 (Project Creation):**
```
Create a simple React component file named Button.jsx with a basic button component
```

**Test Message 3 (File Editing):**
```
Edit the package.json file to add a new script called "dev" that runs "npm start"
```

## üéØ What Should Happen

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
1. **AI responds with JSON action blocks** (not just explanatory text)
2. **Files get created automatically** in your workspace
3. **Success messages appear** in the chat (e.g., "‚úÖ Action completed: Created file hello.js")
4. **No error messages** in the Debug Console

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If It Still Only Chats:

#### Check These Items:
1. **LM Studio Connection**: Verify LM Studio is running on `http://localhost:1234`
2. **Model Response Format**: Your AI model must output structured JSON responses
3. **Debug Console**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac) and check for errors

#### Common Issues:
- **Model not outputting JSON**: Some models need explicit prompting to return structured responses
- **LM Studio offline**: Ensure your local LM Studio server is running
- **Network issues**: Check if `http://localhost:1234` is accessible

## üîß Model Prompting Tips

If your model isn't returning JSON actions, try these prompts:

**System Prompt Enhancement:**
```
You are an AI assistant that can perform file operations. When asked to create, edit, or manage files, respond with a JSON action block in this format:

```json
{
  "action": "create_file",
  "params": {
    "path": "filename.ext",
    "content": "file content here"
  }
}
```

Always include both the JSON action AND a human-readable explanation.
```

**User Prompt Format:**
```
[AGENT_MODE] Create a file named test.js with console.log('test');

Please respond with both a JSON action block and explanation.
```

## üéä You're All Set!

Your configuration is **PERFECT** for agent mode. The extension will now:
- ‚úÖ Execute file creation/editing commands automatically
- ‚úÖ Handle terminal commands (when enabled)
- ‚úÖ Create project structures
- ‚úÖ Perform code analysis and modifications

**No more manual file creation needed** - just chat with your AI and watch it work!

## üìû Next Steps if Issues Persist

If agent mode still doesn't work after testing:
1. Share the exact AI response you receive
2. Check Debug Console for any error messages
3. Verify LM Studio connection with: `curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models`

**You're just one test away from fully functional agent mode!** üöÄ
