# Agent Action Wiring Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides robust wiring between AI responses and VS Code API file operations. The system detects file actions from AI responses and executes them through proper VS Code APIs.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Action Detection
- **Structured JSON parsing**: Detects `{"action": "create_file", "params": {...}}` format
- **Natural language parsing**: Detects phrases like "I'll create a file called X"
- **Code block analysis**: Automatically detects code blocks that could be saved as files
- **Multi-format support**: Handles both explicit JSON commands and conversational responses

### 2. VS Code API Integration
- **File creation**: Uses `vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile()` with proper directory creation
- **File editing**: Shows diff preview before applying changes using `vscode.diff()`
- **User confirmation**: Prompts for confirmation on overwrite/modifications
- **Editor integration**: Automatically opens created/edited files in VS Code editor

### 3. Error Handling & User Experience
- **Permission checks**: Validates file operations before execution
- **Visual feedback**: Shows success/error notifications in the UI
- **Action indicators**: Highlights detected actions in chat responses
- **Cancellation support**: Users can cancel operations at any point

### 4. Action Types Supported

#### create_file
```json
{
  "action": "create_file",
  "params": {
    "path": "src/components/HelloWorld.tsx",
    "content": "import React from 'react';\n\nexport default function HelloWorld() {\n  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;\n}",
    "description": "React Hello World component"
  }
}
```

#### edit_file
```json
{
  "action": "edit_file", 
  "params": {
    "path": "src/App.tsx",
    "content": "// Updated content here",
    "description": "Added new feature to App component"
  }
}
```

#### analyze_file
```json
{
  "action": "analyze_file",
  "params": {
    "path": "src/utils/helpers.ts",
    "description": "Analyze utility functions"
  }
}
```

## Natural Language Detection Examples

The system detects these patterns and converts them to actions:

### File Creation Patterns:
- ✅ "I'll create a file called `example.js` with the following code:"
- ✅ "Let me write this to `components/Button.tsx`:"
- ✅ "I'll save this as `utils/helper.ts`:"

### File Editing Patterns:
- ✅ "I'll edit `src/App.tsx` to add a new component:"
- ✅ "Let me modify the `package.json` file:"
- ✅ "I'll update `README.md` with these changes:"

### Code Block Detection:
- ✅ Any code block with language hint: ```javascript, ```typescript, etc.
- ✅ Code blocks followed by file suggestions
- ✅ Multiple code blocks with file operation context

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Creation
**User**: "Create a hello world JavaScript file"

**AI Response** (gets automatically detected and executed):
```json
{
  "action": "create_file",
  "params": {
    "path": "hello-world.js",
    "content": "console.log('Hello, World!');",
    "description": "Simple hello world script"
  }
}
```

### Natural Language File Creation
**User**: "I need a React component for displaying user profiles"

**AI Response**: "I'll create a file called `UserProfile.tsx` with the following component:"
```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface UserProfileProps {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar?: string;
}

export default function UserProfile({ name, email, avatar }: UserProfileProps) {
  return (
    <div className="user-profile">
      {avatar && <img src={avatar} alt={name} />}
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>{email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
*This response is automatically detected and the file is created with user confirmation.*

## Implementation Architecture

```
User Message → AgentManager.processMessage()
                     ↓
           LMStudioClient.sendMessage() (with enhanced system prompt)
                     ↓
           AgentManager.parseStructuredResponse() 
                     ↓
           [JSON Format] OR [Natural Language] OR [Code Block]
                     ↓
           AgentManager.executeStructuredAction()
                     ↓
           VS Code APIs (fs.writeFile, diff, showTextDocument)
                     ↓
           ChatProvider.processActionResult()
                     ↓
           Enhanced UI Feedback (notifications, action indicators)
```

## Files Modified

### Core Logic:
- **`src/agent/AgentManager.ts`**: Enhanced parsing and VS Code API integration
- **`src/chat/ChatProvider.ts`**: Action result processing and user feedback
- **`src/lmstudio/LMStudioClient.ts`**: Improved system prompt for better AI responses

### UI Components:
- **`src/webview/components/ChatInterface.tsx`**: Action suggestion handling
- **`src/webview/types/messages.ts`**: Added metadata support for actions
- **`src/webview/types/api.ts`**: New command types and message events
- **`src/webview/hooks/useWebviewApi.ts`**: Action execution API
- **`src/webview/styles/ChatInterface.css`**: Info notification styling

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Examples:

1. **Simple file creation**:
   - Type: "Create a hello world Python script"
   - Expected: File `hello-world.py` created with print statement

2. **Natural language detection**:
   - Type: "I need a configuration file for my app"
   - Expected: AI suggests file creation, detects action, prompts for execution

3. **Code block conversion**:
   - Type: "Show me a TypeScript interface for a user"
   - Expected: AI provides code block, system detects potential file creation

4. **File editing**:
   - Type: "Edit my package.json to add a new dependency"
   - Expected: Shows current content, AI suggests changes, diff preview shown

## Key Advantages

1. **Non-disruptive**: Works with existing chat flow - no UI changes needed
2. **Intelligent**: Detects actions even when AI doesn't use perfect JSON format
3. **Safe**: Always asks for user confirmation before file operations
4. **Integrated**: Uses proper VS Code APIs instead of direct file system access
5. **Flexible**: Supports multiple AI response patterns and formats

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multi-file project generation
- Implement workspace-wide refactoring actions
- Add git integration for committing created files
- Support for template-based file generation
- Integration with VS Code extensions and marketplace
