- [ ] Bundle size < 2MB after optimization
- [ ] Input responses feel instant (<100ms)
- [ ] Memory usage stays stable during long sessions

### STEP 5: Enhance Error Handling & Recovery üõ°Ô∏è
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Estimated Time: 1-2 days**

**Missing Components:**
- No React error boundaries
- No offline mode detection
- No retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Create `src/webview/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Add offline mode detection and graceful degradation
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Add connection status indicators
- Create helpful error states with action buttons
- Add error reporting and logging system

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] React errors don't crash entire interface
- [ ] Offline mode shows helpful message
- [ ] Failed requests retry automatically
- [ ] Connection status is always visible

### STEP 6: Complete Security & Validation üîí
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Estimated Time: 1-2 days**

**Missing Components:**
- Incomplete CSP implementation
- Missing comprehensive command validation
- No file operation permissions system

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Add comprehensive Content Security Policy to webview
- Enhance command validation with security levels
- Create file operation permissions system
- Add input sanitization for all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Complete audit trail for all operations

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] CSP prevents XSS attacks
- [ ] Dangerous commands require explicit approval
- [ ] File operations respect workspace permissions
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API abuse

### STEP 7: Polish User Experience & Animations üé®
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Estimated Time: 1-2 days**

**Missing Components:**
- Some animations need 60fps optimization
- Missing accessibility features
- Incomplete keyboard navigation

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Optimize all animations for 60fps performance
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Perfect theme integration with VS Code
- Add contextual menus and tooltips
- Implement loading states and skeleton loaders
- Add micro-interactions and hover effects

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All animations run at 60fps
